# RUN SCOTLAND

Front-end: Vue.js, Vuex, Vue-Router, Vuetify, Open-Layers

Back-end: Firestore DB/Auth

Language: JavaScript.

A run finding web-app, build with JavaScript, that allows users to upload and manage their own routes, while also favouriting and downloading those they find from others.  It uses Firebase Authentication and a Cloud Firestore DB on the back-end, while running Vue.js, Vuex and Vue-Routing, Vuetify and Open-layers on the front.

Currently provides the ability to view routes on a map, however the code to plot each run is contained within the files, but not streamlined, so is commented out. You can click on each run however to find details about it.  You soon will be able to download the route's GPX data, while also uploading same.  You will be able to manage routes specific to you.

There are plans to implement route drawing, so you can plot/plan a route, and save same.
